        "part4": "Trading taught me to read patterns, make quick decisions with incomplete information, and manage risk.",
        "part5": "These skills naturally transfer to development: anticipating edge cases, planning for uncertainty, and knowing when to cut your losses rather than clinging to a solution that isn't working."
