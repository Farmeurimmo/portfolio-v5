**Grade: 95/100**

I already had basic HTML knowledge before this project, which allowed me to focus more on content structure, responsive
design, and accessibility.

### Overview

The goal of this project was to create a fully functional website similar to AirBnB/Booking using only HTML and CSS,
without any frameworks, libraries, templates, or generative AI. The focus was on code quality, responsive design, and
accessibility compliance.
