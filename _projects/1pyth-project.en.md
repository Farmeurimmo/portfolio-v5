### General Description

This project consists of programming two abstract combinatorial strategy games in Python, with full rule management and
console interface.

### Snort Game

Players alternately place a piece on an empty square not orthogonally adjacent to an opponent’s piece. The player who
cannot move loses.
Functions include: board creation, display, placement validation, board update, and turn management.

### Dodgem Game

Move your pieces on a square board with direction restrictions. Win by moving all your pieces off the board or blocking
the opponent.
Functions include: board initialization with pieces, display, move validation, input handling, and victory detection.

### Important Notes

- No global variables.
- Strict input validation.
- Clear and well-structured code.
- Documentation included explaining algorithms.
