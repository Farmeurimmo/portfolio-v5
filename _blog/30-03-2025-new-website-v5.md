# V5 of My Portfolio

Long time no see! I haven't posted anything since the last article about the Skyblock plugin.

The reason: I've been too busy with my studies and projects. However, I plan to slowly get back to my blog and post more
articles about my work.

## New Website

Once again, I’ve redesigned my website, almost exactly one year after the previous version. I wanted to improve my
portfolio by using my new skills in web development and to make it more user-friendly.

I’ve kept the blog articles and projects from the last version, but with a new design and added features.

The view count is currently not implemented in the new version because I’m unsure if I’ll keep it or not.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15
- React 19
- Tailwind CSS 4
- DaisyUI 5

## Features

- Multilingual (French and English for now) with i18n and path-based routing (`/en` and `/fr`)
- Contact form
- Blog (in markdown, no more weird API fetches with XSS risks)
- Projects
- Dark mode + light mode
- Responsive design
- Legal mentions
- Dynamic sitemap (updated every time I add a new page)
- Pre generated pages (for SEO)

## Conclusion

I hope you like the new design and features. I’ll try to post more articles about my projects and studies. If you have
any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me via the contact form or on my social media.

I’ll try to answer as soon as possible.

Thanks for reading!
